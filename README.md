## FlightCatch 

This application is for users to be able to book and reserve flights from our Java-based
Web Application. Users could create an account and login to see what flights will be 
available. Then, users could book and reserve their flights based off of the city and time
frame that they would like. After the user would book and reserve their flights, a user could 
rate their flight based off their experiences and view comments that other users may have based
off their experiences. 

What motivated for the creation of this application was the importance of having a user-friendly 
application and also the uniqueness of having a user-based rating system of their flight 
experiences. 

Some of the tools that we use in the development of the application is MySQL Workbench for the 
database of the application, using a Tomcat server towards running this web-based application, 
and using the Eclipse IDE towards developing the frontend of the application. The coding languages
that were used in this application are MySQL, Java, HTML, and CSS.
